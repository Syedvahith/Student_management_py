# Python-tkinter-Project
A small CRUD system for a test Dance Academy using tkinter in Python. 
Here,
- Admins can perform CRUD operations on the instructors as well as sessions. 
- Instructors can register students to the academy. 
- The system will match the requirements of the students with the qualifications of the instructors and suggest a suitable instructor that the admin can then assign to the student.
